## Problem 2

``` r
data_mr_trash = read_excel("Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
data_mr_trash$sports_balls = as.integer(round(data_mr_trash$sports_balls)) 
```

``` r
data_prof_trash = read_excel("Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

``` r
data_mr_trash$trash_wheel = "mr"
data_prof_trash$trash_wheel = "prof"
data_mr_trash$year = as.double(data_mr_trash$year)
data_joined_trash = full_join(data_mr_trash, data_prof_trash)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("dumpster", "month", "year", "date", "weight_tons",
    ## "volume_cubic_yards", "plastic_bottles", "polystyrene", "cigarette_butts",
    ## "glass_bottles", "grocery_bags", "chip_bags", "homes_powered", "trash_wheel")

The number of observations in the resulting dataset is 641. Some
examples of key variables are dumpster, year, weight_tons, and
sports_balls. The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash
Wheel is 190.12 tons. The total number of sports balls collected by
Mr.Â Trash Wheel in 2020 is 856.
